**User:** Asked whether a new npm publish is required for README/package.json updates to appear on the registry.

**Assistant:** Explained that npm uses the published package tarball for README and metadata, so a new version and publish are required to update registry contents.

**User:** Asked to update both Cesium demos to consume geopose-lib as a regular npm dependency.

**Assistant:** Added geopose-lib as a dependency in both demo package.json files, removed the local alias from the transforms test Vite config, and updated both Cesium GeoPoseConverter modules to use geopose-lib types and YPR/quaternion conversions.
