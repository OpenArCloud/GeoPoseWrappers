## Session Start

New devlog initiated for this repository.

---

## Exchange 1

**User:** Initiated devlog for GeoPoseWrappers repository.

**Assistant:** Created `devlog/` directory and initialized first logfile.

## Exchange 2

**User:** Requested a split-view visualization app showing Cesium (global context) and Three.js (local AR session frame) to demonstrate geopose-lib transforms for AR scenarios where a device has a GeoPose from VPS and needs to place assets in a local coordinate frame that is ground-aligned but not necessarily ENU-aligned.

**Assistant:** Created new sandbox app `ar-local-frame-demo` with:
- Split-view layout: Cesium on left (global Earth view), Three.js on right (local AR frame)
- AR device and 3D asset visualization in both views
- Interactive controls for AR device GeoPose, AR session yaw offset, and asset GeoPose
- Core transform using `geoPoseToLocalENU()` plus yaw rotation to convert asset's global GeoPose to AR session's local frame
- Visual axes showing ENU vs AR frame orientation difference
- Preset scenarios for different use cases

work stopped while trying to implement:

  ☐ Add full yaw/pitch/roll controls for device camera orientation
  ☐ Add device local pose within AR session (position + orientation in session frame)
  ☐ Compute AR Session Origin GeoPose from device camera GeoPose + local pose
  ☐ Add third view: device camera perspective (what AR device sees)
  ☐ Add proper 3D asset visualization in all views
  ☐ Update transform chain to show full flow
