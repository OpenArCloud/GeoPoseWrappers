# Conversation Log - 2026-01-13 (15:00 hour)

## Session Start

Continuing from previous session (`logfile_2026_01_13_13.md`).

---

## Exchange 17

**User:** Asked for the current working directory.

**Assistant:** Ran `pwd` and reported `/Users/janerivi/prodev/claudeland/Geospatial`. Noted a zsh permission warning from `.zprofile` unrelated to the directory result.

---

## Exchange 18

**User:** Asked whether the agent can only edit files within `/Users/janerivi/prodev/claudeland/Geospatial`.

**Assistant:** Confirmed the sandbox allows editing only within that root (read access elsewhere), and that edits outside would require approval/escalation.

---

## Exchange 19

**User:** Asked which mode the agent is in and how to check/change it.

**Assistant:** Reported `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`, `network_access=restricted`, and `approval_policy=on-request`, and noted these are controlled via the Codex CLI configuration or launch options.

---

## Exchange 20

**User:** Noted a UI dropdown to switch between Chat, Agent, and Agent (full access).

**Assistant:** Explained that “Agent (full access)” corresponds to `danger-full-access`, “Agent” is sandboxed, and “Chat” does not run tools. Mentioned switching modes or requesting per-command approvals.

---

## Exchange 21

**User:** Requested a review of the GeoPoseWrappers repo (including logs/plans/proposals), continued logging, and a code review of the TypeScript transforms library and tests, plus proposed improvements and demo extensions.

**Assistant:** Read all logfiles and project plans/proposals, then began reviewing the TypeScript transforms library and its tests/demo for findings and improvement proposals.

---

## Exchange 22

**User:** Asked to write up the review as a plan in `transform-lib-improvements.md`, and amend it with a plan for real-world locations/GLB assets/Google 3D Tiles plus projected-coordinate transforms and demo updates.

**Assistant:** Created `transform-lib-improvements.md` with phased improvements, expanded testing, real-world scenario data and demo updates, plus UTM/projected transform APIs and demo integration details.
