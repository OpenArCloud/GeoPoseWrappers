**User:** Asked to look into the GeoPoseWrappers log files and continue the logging practice accordingly.

**Assistant:**
- Reviewed previous log files (`logfile_2026_01_12_00.md` and `logfile_2026_01_13_09.md`) to understand the documentation style and recent context.
- Reviewed `wrapper-plan.md` to identify high-level project goals.
- Established `task.md` to track current session work.
- Created this new log file (`logfile_2026_01_13_13.md`) to continue the documentation practice.
- Checked status of recent tasks:
    - Serialization support (Exchange 9-10): Implemented.
    - Cesium demo improvements (Exchange 12-13): Implemented.

Ready for the next specific task from the user.

## Exchange 16

**User:** Requested implementation of the GeoPose Transforms library in TypeScript, along with verifiable test data, unit tests, and a Cesium verification app.

**Assistant:**
1.  **Created `implementation_plan.md`**: Outlined the structure for the library and verification tools.
2.  **Implemented Library (`geopose-transforms/typescript`)**:
    - `src/types.ts`: Core OGC definitions.
    - `src/core/conversions.ts`: WGS84 ECEF/LLH and Helix/YPR conversions.
    - `src/core/local.ts`: Local Tangent Plane (ENU) operations.
    - `src/core/advanced.ts`: Relative poses and interpolation.
3.  **Generated Test Data**:
    - Created `test/generate-test-data.ts`.
    - Generated `test-data/geopose-transforms-test-data.json` with standardized test vectors.
4.  **Unit Testing**:
    - Implemented `test/transforms.test.ts` using Vitest.
    - Verified all tests passed (`npm run test`).
5.  **Interactive Verification App**:
    - Created `sandbox/cesium-transforms-test`.
    - Configured Vite alias to link to the local library.
    - Implemented `App.svelte` with a visual "Test Runner" to verify operations (Translation, Interpolation) in the 3D engine.
6.  **Documentation**:
    - Created `walkthrough.md` detailing the implementation and usage commands.
